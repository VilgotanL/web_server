        <h1>brainf**k</h1>
        <p>
            Brainf**k is an esoteric programming language (esolang) where there are only 8 instructions all of which are a single character long,<br>
            all other characters are comments and they are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            In brainf**k there is a tape going right that consists of bytes that can hold numbers between 0 to 255, initially 0,<br>
            there is also a pointer that starts on the leftmost cell of the tape.
        </p>
        <p>
            0 0 0 0 0 ...<br>
            ^
        </p>
        <p>
            You can move the tape pointer left and right with &gt; and &lt;,<br>
            and you can increment (+1) and decrement (-1) the current cell with + and -.<br>
            When you increment past 255 the cell overflows back to 0, and vice-versa for decrementing.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can print the current cell's value as an ascii character with the dot (.),<br>
            and you can input an ascii character with the comma (,).
        </p>
        <p>
            The two last instructions are [ and ], they combined act as a while-not-zero loop,<br>
            [code] runs while the current cell is not zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of []:<br>
            [-] set the current cell to zero<br>
            [->+&lt;] move the current cell's value to the next cell
        </p>

        <h2>Edge Cases</h2>
        <p>
            If the pointer goes left of the leftmost cell, the behaviour is undefined.<br>
            If [ and ] are unbalanced or used in an invalid way, the behaviour is undefined.<br>
            If the end of input (aka eof) is reached the most common thing for an implementation is to leave the cell as-is or set it to 0, some implementations set it to -1.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Example Programs</h2>
        <h3>Cat program</h3>
        <p>
            Prints the input<br>
            ,[.,]
